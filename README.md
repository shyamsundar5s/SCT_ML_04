# ✋🧠 GestureFlow: Intelligent Hand Gesture Recognition for Touchless Interfaces

Imagine controlling a computer with nothing but a wave of your hand. Welcome to *GestureFlow*, a high-performance hand gesture recognition model designed to detect, identify, and classify hand gestures from images and videos—enabling seamless, natural interaction between humans and machines.

Whether you're building smart environments, accessibility tools, or futuristic UI/UX systems, this repo is your launchpad for developing gesture-based control applications.

🎯 *Goal:* Develop a computer vision and ML pipeline that accurately identifies hand gestures for gesture-based control systems.  
📸 *Input:* Static images or dynamic video frames containing human hands.  
🖐 *Output:* Classified gesture labels (e.g., "Thumbs Up", "Peace", "Fist") with confidence scores.

Gesture recognition is powered by state-of-the-art tools such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning models, offering real-time prediction capabilities.
